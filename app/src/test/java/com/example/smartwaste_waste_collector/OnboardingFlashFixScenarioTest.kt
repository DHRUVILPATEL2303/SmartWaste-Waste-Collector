        // 1. App starts
        // 2. collectAsState(initial = false) immediately returns false
        // 3. Navigation logic executes with false → goes to onboarding
        // 4. DataStore loads actual value (true)
        // 5. collectAsState emits true
        // 6. Navigation logic re-executes with true → goes to home
        // 7. Result: User sees onboarding screen flash before home screen
        
        // The fixed sequence:
        // 1. App starts
        val step1_initialState = OnboardingState.Loading
        assertTrue("Step 1: Should start with Loading", step1_initialState is OnboardingState.Loading)
        
        // 2. Navigation logic checks state - sees Loading and returns early
        // No navigation happens yet
        
        // 3. DataStore loads actual value and emits Loaded state
        val step3_actualValue = true // User completed onboarding
        val step3_loadedState = OnboardingState.Loaded(step3_actualValue)
        
        // 4. Navigation logic executes with Loaded state - makes correct decision
        assertTrue("Step 3: Should be Loaded state", step3_loadedState is OnboardingState.Loaded)
        assertTrue("Step 3: Should show completion", step3_loadedState.isCompleted)
        
        // 5. Result: Direct navigation to correct destination, no flash
        
        // The key improvement:
        // - Loading state prevents premature navigation decisions
        // - Only one navigation happens (to correct destination)
        // - Eliminates the flash effect
